# Employee_Attrition_SVM
Pre-processing the Data and Model Preparation:
To prepare the EmployeeData.csv dataset for analysis, we performed pre-processing tasks, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations, and normalizing numerical variables. Additionally, we split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure proper evaluation of the models. These steps ensured that the data was ready for the classification modeling phase.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) Model:
We built a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model to predict employee attrition. SVMs are powerful classifiers that aim to find an optimal hyperplane to separate different classes. During the modeling process, we experimented with different model settings, such as kernel types, regularization parameters, and class weights, to identify the best performing model. Through iterative experimentation and evaluation of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, we determined the optimal SVM model for predicting employee attrition.
